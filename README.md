# rc-power-measurement

This project helps to measure the current and voltage from the Li-ion or li-Po battery packs using a precision rectifier and a current sensor INA169
The two measuring systems are combined into one module.The module is compact and give an analog output.
The detailed specifications are mentioned in the data sheet.

Range used: 50v/90amps with analog output scaled to 3.3v and 12 bit adc resolution preferred.
